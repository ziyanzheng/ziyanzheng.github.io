The Free Speech Movement (FSM) was a massive, long-lasting student protest which took place during the 1964–65 academic year on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. The Movement was informally under the central leadership of Berkeley graduate student Mario Savio. In fact, the Free Speech Movement is a result of the interaction of history and current affairs, international and American self development. From the east to the west, the wave of world revolution swept the country and shacked the whole world. This talk is divided into 4 parts: background, process, Mario Savio and influence. <br>
This is a presentation in UC Berkeley with Jialin Yang, Qiuyi Zhan and Puzheng Zhang. It is worth mentioning that one of our presenters Qiuyi Zhan is also an intern of the well-known《令人心动的offer第二季》 in 2020-2021.
